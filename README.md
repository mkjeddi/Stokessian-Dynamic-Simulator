# SDS Manual and Examples
This is a tutorial for the Stokessian Dynamics Simulator (SDS). SDS is a C++ code to simulate time evolution of particulate suspensions with possible charge transfer between particles while interacting with each other and with a confining flat wall. The time evolution of particles is simulated using Stokesian dynamics and the electric potential interactions between particles are simulated using Resistor-Capacitor formulation. Detailed thoretical background of SDS is provided in following publications:

- M. Karzar-Jeddi, H. Luo, P.T. Cummings, Mobilities of polydisperse hard spheres near a no-slip wall, Computers & Fluids, 2018
- M. Karzar-Jeddi, H. Luo, P.T. Cummings, K.B. Hatzell, Computational Modeling of Particle Hydrodynamics and Charging Process for the Flowable Electrodes of Carbon Slurry, Journal of Electrochemical Society


# Requirements

The SDS code can run on both Windows and Linux. On a Windows machine, the code can be compiled using Microsoft Visual Studiio. Prequisite for using Microsoft Visual Studio is installation of LAPACK package, linear algebra package. Instructions on how to install LAPACK in Microsoft Visual Studio are provided in:
https://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/VisualStudio_install.html

On Linux machine the code can be compiled using g++. However LAPACK package has to be installed perior and address through makefile in SDS package.

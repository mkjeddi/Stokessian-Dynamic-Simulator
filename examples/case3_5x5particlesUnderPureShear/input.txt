lubrication paramerers [r_max, r_min^2, and n_max for unequal spheres]
Notes: 
- Extra care has to be taken when using periodic boundary conditions flag_per = 1 or 2
  to have r_max smaller than calculation cell size in three directions.
- The best lubrication limit in free space is four times of the particle radius.
